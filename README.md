#React/Redux Front-end Implementation with a Rails 5 API Backend
React makes this app quick and efficient. React Router provides RESTful routing, and the entries are stored in a Rails 5 API backend with a PostgreSQL database. This is served to the frontend in JSON format via Rails serializers.

# API

This app uses a Rails API backend. API endpoints render JSON. Entries are all available on the API, indexed or individual show. For example, to view the entries index, click on All Entries.
